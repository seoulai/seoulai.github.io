  ML = Machine Learning

  A [10x developer](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/31673/10x-developer) is an individual who is thought to be as productive as 10 others in his or her field. 
  The 10x developer would produce 10 times the outcomes of other colleagues, in a production, engineering or software design environment.
  A 10x developer is also known as a 10x programmer or 10x engineer.

## What will be covered?
  I am open to suggestions, but for now I would suggest **Dive into Deep Learning** book.
  http://en.diveintodeeplearning.org/

  * 600+ pages
  * includes Jupyter notebooks
  * MXNEt (doesn't mean that we have to/will use it!)
  * about deep learning but that does not mean we have to focus on Deep Learning only!

## Group focus
  * Understand theory
  * Algorithm design
  * Implementation and optimization
  * Model training
  * Deployment

## Who is this group for? For people ...
  * want to become the best ML developers
  * want to start a startup
  * like challenges

 If you agreed with at least one point you are probably the right fit.

## What will be the final goal of this group?
  Not sure yet.

## When?

Negotiable but I would suggest that we meet

* every two weeks on Tuesday evening at 8 PM
* starting from January 8, 2019

## Where?
  [Join the slack channel](https://seoulai.slack.com/messages/CEU0W110Q)


## Prerequisite

* You should read following chapters (198 pages) from **Dive into Deep Learning** book:
  1. Introduction
  2. A taste of Deep Learning
  3. Deep Learning Basics

* It is not necessary to read about MXNet, but you should be able to to implement the same solutions in any other framework or language.
* If you don't finish reading all suggested content, it is okay, but ...
* The meeting will be in a form of group discussion.
* If you don't understand some part, others will try to explain it to you, but always to try understand first before asking.


## Foreigner friendly?
  Yes, English is be the main language of group, but you can communicate in any language.
