  ML = Machine Learning

  A [10x developer](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/31673/10x-developer) is an individual who is thought to be as productive as 10 others in his or her field. 
  The 10x developer would produce 10 times the outcomes of other colleagues, in a production, engineering or software design environment.
  A 10x developer is also known as a 10x programmer or 10x engineer.

## What will be covered?
  I am open to suggestions, but for now I would suggest **Dive into Deep Learning** book.
  http://en.diveintodeeplearning.org/

  - 600+ pages
  - includes Jupyter notebooks
  - MXNEt (doesn't mean that we have to/will use it!)
  - about deep learning but that does not mean we have to focus on Deep Learning only!

## Group focus
  - Understand theory
  - Algorithm design
  - Implementation and optimization
  - Model training
  - Deployment

## Who is this group for? For people ...
  - want to become the best ML developers
  - want to start a startup
  - like challenges

 If you agreed with at least one point you are probably the right fit.

## What will be the final goal of this group?
  Not sure yet.

## When?
  Negotiable but I would suggest that we meet

  - every two weeks on Tuesday evening at 8 PM
  - starting from January 8, 2019
    - You should read following chapters (198 pages) from **Dive into Deep Learning** book:
        1. Introduction
        2. A taste of Deep Learning
        3. Deep Learning Basics
    - It is not necessary to read about MXNet, but you should be able to to implement the same solutions in any other framework or language.
    - If you don't finish reading all suggested content, it is okay, but ...
    - The meeting will be in a form of group discussion.
    - If you don't understand some part, others will try to explain it to you, but always to try understand first before asking.

## Where?
  Hyperconnect 14th floor or somewhere in Gangnam

## Foreigner friendly?
  Yes, English is be the main language of group, but you can communicate in any language.
