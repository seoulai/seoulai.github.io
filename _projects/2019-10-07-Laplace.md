## Laplace's demon
  [Laplace's demon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laplace%27s_demon) was the first published articulation of causal or scientific determinism, by Pierre-Simon Laplace in 1814.
  According to determinism, if someone (the demon) knows the precise location and momentum of every atom in the universe, their past and future values for any given time are entailed;
  they can be calculated from the laws of classical mechanics.
