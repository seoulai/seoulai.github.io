If you feel ready to present, please fill out this form [https://bit.ly/seoulai-talk-proposal](https://bit.ly/seoulai-talk-proposal).

## Examples of topic propositions

* Competing in [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) or any other only data science competition

You are not limited to proposals listed above, feel free to suggest anything relevant!

## Lightning talk

If you don't feel ready for long presentation, you can still contribute in the form of [lightning talk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning_talk)!
Lightning talk is a short presentation between 5 and 10 minutes. You can for example briefly describe what you currently work on, what you got stuck on and how you solved or you can just introduce new tool which helped you to boost your productivity.

For a lightning talk we do not need to know in advance that you will present, but we can't guarantee there will be a free time slot for you.
