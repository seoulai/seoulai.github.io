## Overview

Seoul AI is hosting third AI hackathon on Saturday, October 13th. Hackathon is based on the new toolkit from Seoul AI for developing AI algorithms: Seoul AI Gym. This gym simulates various environments and enables the use of any teaching technique on an agent. The goal of every hackathon participant is to develop an agent that can play Checkers. Each participant will train an agent to compete in a tournament. We encourage participants to use any machine learning algorithm of their choice. No particular training set will be given. Each participant will have their own responsibility to find a way to train their own agent.


## Tournament

The competition will be a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bracket_(tournament)">Tournament Tree</a> will be held in the following way:

- The Tournament Tree will be generated randomly.
- All trained agents will compete in 1v1 for several games during 1 minute. The winner will be the agent with the higher number of wins. In the case of an equality, the agent who won the first game will be the winner.
- Agents are allowed to learn during the competition.
- If an agent takes more than 1 seconds to act, random move will be perfomed automatically.
